\section{Problem Statement}
Content:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What are rag systems? What do they do?
  \item What is the goal of Aidvice?
  \item What are problems with oncology guidelines specifically?
  \item Why is chunking important for rag systems? What are positive benefits of good chunking?
\end{itemize}

Ever since the release of the original ChatGPT model by OpenAI in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption across various domains. Since then, LLMs have revolutionized how we access and retrieve information, enabling users to interact with vast amounts of data through natural language queries alone.

% Recently, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems have been proposed as a solution to mitigate these issues. 

\section{Objectives}
Research questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1:} How does a document segmentation benchmark created on oncology guidelines compare to established research document benchmarks?
  \item \textbf{RQ2:} Which metrics are most useful to measure the effectiveness of visual segmentation methods?
  \item \textbf{RQ3:} How can current segmentation methods be adapted or expanded on to improve performance on oncology guidelines?
\end{itemize}
