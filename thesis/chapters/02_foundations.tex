\section{Document Parsing}

Also known as document content extraction, \gls{dp} aims to convert unstructured and semi-structured documents into structured data formats.\cite{parsingunveiled} During this process elements such as headings, tables, and figures are extracted from the document while preserving their structural relationships. \\

While there are many tools available for document parsing, most of them can be categorized into either modular pipeline systems or end-to-end VLM models.

\subsection{Modular Pipeline Systems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition
  \item Common Pipeline Stages
  \item Types of Pipelines (with VLM, VLM only for Element Recognition)
  \item Examples (Docling, Unstructured.io, many proprietary solutions)
  \item Problems (Error Propagation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{End-to-End VLM models}
\todo{Maybe add something about History?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition
  \item Difference between Specialized and general vlms
  \item Examples
  \item Problems
\end{itemize}
