  abstract = {In the realm of computer vision, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance. Video Processing, Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Image Classification, Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing are some of the application areas of CNN. Object detection is the most crucial and challenging task of computer vision. It has numerous applications in the field of security, military, transportation and medical sciences. In this review, object detection and its different aspects have been covered in detail. With the gradual increase in the evolution of deep learning algorithms for detecting objects, a significant improvement in the performance of object detection models has been observed. However, this does not imply that the conventional object detection methods, which had been evolving for decades prior to the emergence of deep learning, had become outdated. There are some cases where conventional methods with global features are superior choice. This review paper starts with a quick overview of object detection followed by object detection frameworks, backbone convolutional neural network, and an overview of common datasets along with the evaluation metrics. Object detection problems and applications are also studied in detail. Some future research challenges in designing deep neural networks are discussed. Lastly, the performance of object detection models on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets is compared and conclusions are drawn.}

  abstract       = {Recent outstanding results of supervised object detection in competitions and challenges are often associated with specific metrics and datasets. The evaluation of such methods applied in different contexts have increased the demand for annotated datasets. Annotation tools represent the location and size of objects in distinct formats, leading to a lack of consensus on the representation. Such a scenario often complicates the comparison of object detection methods. This work alleviates this problem along the following lines: (i) It provides an overview of the most relevant evaluation methods used in object detection competitions, highlighting their peculiarities, differences, and advantages; (ii) it examines the most used annotation formats, showing how different implementations may influence the assessment results; and (iii) it provides a novel open-source toolkit supporting different annotation formats and 15 performance metrics, making it easy for researchers to evaluate the performance of their detection algorithms in most known datasets. In addition, this work proposes a new metric, also included in the toolkit, for evaluating object detection in videos that is based on the spatio-temporal overlap between the ground-truth and detected bounding boxes.},

  abstract       = {This study compares various F1-score variants—micro, macro, and weighted—to assess their performance in evaluating text-based emotion classification. Lexicon distillation is employed using the multilabel emotion-annotated datasets XED and GoEmotions. The aim of this paper is to understand when each F1-score variant is better suited for evaluating text-based multilabel emotion classification. Unigram lexicons were derived from the annotated GoEmotions and XED datasets through a binary classification approach. The distilled lexicons were then applied to the GoEmotions and XED annotated datasets to calculate their emotional content, and the results were compared. The findings highlight the behavior of each F1-score variant under different class distributions, emphasizing the importance of appropriate metric selection for reliable model performance evaluation in imbalanced multilabel datasets. Additionally, this study also investigates the effect of the aggregation of negative emotions into broader categories on said F1 metrics. The contribution of this study is to provide insights into how different F1-score variants could improve the reliability of multilabel emotion classifier evaluation, particularly in the context of class imbalance present in the case of phishing emails.},

While sentences are usually converted into unique subword sequences, subword segmentation is potentially ambiguous and multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary. The question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to harness the segmentation ambiguity as a noise to improve the robustness of NMT. We present a simple regularization method, subword regularization, which trains the model with multiple subword segmentations probabilistically sampled during training. In addition, for better subword sampling, we propose a new subword segmentation algorithm based on a unigram language model. We experiment with multiple corpora and report consistent improvements especially on low resource and out-of-domain settings.}

While existing subword segmentation tools assume that the input is pre-tokenized into word sequences, SentencePiece can train subword models directly from raw sentences, which allows us to make a purely end-to-end and language independent system. We perform a validation experiment of NMT on English-Japanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy to direct subword training from raw sentences. We also compare the performance of subword training and segmentation with various configurations.

One of the key challenges in optimizing RAG systems is the selection of an appropriate retrieval dataset, which directly affects model accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and response coherence. The chunk size plays a fundamental role in the performance of RAG systems, as it directly impacts retrieval efficiency, response quality, and computational costs. The Neural Bridge RAG Dataset 12000 was used to test the effect of a chunk size in our experiment.},

  abstract  = {In the daily work, vast amounts of documents are stored in pixel-based formats such as images and scanned PDFs, posing challenges for efficient database management and data processing. Existing methods often fragment the parsing process into the pipeline of separated subtasks on the layout element level, resulting in incomplete semantics and error propagation. Even though models based on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) mitigate the issues to some extent, they also suffer from absent or sub-optimal grounding ability for visual information. To address these challenges, we introduce the Intelligent Document Parsing (IDP) framework, an end-to-end document parsing framework leveraging the vision-language priors of MLLMs, equipped with an elaborately designed document representation and decoding mechanism to decouple the content parsing and layout grounding to fully activate the potential of MLLMs for document parsing. Experimental results demonstrate that the IDP method surpasses existing methods, significantly advancing MLLM-based document parsing.}

  abstract = {Clinical practices guidelines (CPGs) play a fundamental role in improving healthcare and patients' outcomes by helping clinicians make the best evidence-based decisions for their patients in a time-efficient manner. By following the available methods and criteria to create trustworthy CPGs, panel members can develop high-quality guidelines. However, despite the improvements over the years, CPGs are still subjected to biases and limitations, with conflicts of interest being the ugliest problem GCPs must face. In this review, we discuss the main characteristics of clinical practice guidelines, their pros and cons, and the future challenges they need to overcome.}

  abstract  = {Document retrieval can be considered as a basic but important tool for text mining that is capable of taking a user's information need into account. However, document retrieval is a hard task if multitopic lengthy documents have to be retrieved with a very short description (a few keywords) of the information need. In this paper, we focus on this problem which is typical in real world applications. We experimentally validate that passage-based document retrieval is advantageous in such circumstances as compared to conventional document retrieval. Passage-based document retrieval is a kind of document retrieval which takes into account only small fractions (passages) of documents to judge the document relevance to the information need. As a passage-based method, we employ the method based on density distributions of keywords. This is compared with the following three conventional methods for document retrieval: the vector space model, pseudo-feedback, and latent semantic indexing. Experimental results show that the passagebased method is superior to the conventional methods if long documents have to be retrieved by short queries.},

  abstract   = {Large, pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT and GPT have drastically changed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. For numerous NLP tasks, approaches leveraging PLMs have achieved state-of-the-art performance. The key idea is to learn a generic, latent representation of language from a generic task once, then share it across disparate NLP tasks. Language modeling serves as the generic task, one with abundant self-supervised text available for extensive training. This article presents the key fundamental concepts of PLM architectures and a comprehensive view of the shift to PLM-driven NLP techniques. It surveys work applying the pre-training then fine-tuning, prompting, and text generation approaches. In addition, it discusses PLM limitations and suggested directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a widely-used tool for information seeking, but their generated outputs are prone to hallucination. In this work, our aim is to allow LLMs to generate text with citations, improving their factual correctness and verifiability. Existing work mainly relies on commercial search engines and human evaluation, making it challenging to reproduce and compare different modeling approaches. We propose ALCE, the first benchmark for Automatic LLMs' Citation Evaluation. ALCE collects a diverse set of questions and retrieval corpora and requires building end-to-end systems to retrieve supporting evidence and generate answers with citations. We develop automatic metrics along three dimensions{---}fluency, correctness, and citation quality{---}and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgements. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and novel prompting strategies show that current systems have considerable room for improvement{---}For example, on the ELI5 dataset, even the best models lack complete citation support 50{\%} of the time. Our analyses further highlight promising future directions, including developing better retrievers, advancing long-context LLMs, and improving the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.}

  abstract = {Hierarchical data are often modelled as trees. An interesting query identifies pairs of similar trees. The standard approach to tree similarity is the tree edit distance, which has successfully been applied in a wide range of applications. In terms of runtime, the state-of-the-art algorithm for the tree edit distance is RTED, which is guaranteed to be fast independent of the tree shape. Unfortunately, this algorithm requires up to twice the memory of its competitors. The memory is quadratic in the tree size and is a bottleneck for the tree edit distance computation. In this paper we present a new, memory efficient algorithm for the tree edit distance, AP-TED (All Path Tree Edit Distance). Our algorithm runs at least as fast as RTED without trading in memory efficiency. This is achieved by releasing memory early during the first step of the algorithm, which computes a decomposition strategy for the actual distance computation. We show the correctness of our approach and prove an upper bound for the memory usage. The strategy computed by AP-TED is optimal in the class of all-path strategies, which subsumes the class of LRH strategies used in RTED. We further present the AP-TED+ algorithm, which requires less computational effort for very small subtrees and improves the runtime of the distance computation. Our experimental evaluation confirms the low memory requirements and the runtime efficiency of our approach.}
