Gemini models are trained to output coordinates from 0 to 1000, with the origin at the left-top corner of the image. Additionally, they are trained to provide bounding boxes as tuples in the $(y_0,x_0,y_1,x_1)$ format. In order to maximize the accuracy of detected bounding boxes, \lstinline|box_2d|, the key used in Google's official documentation, is used to denote the bounding box tuples in the output \gls{json}.}
