\chapter*{AI Assistant Usage Disclosure}

\section*{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Performing work or conducting research at the Chair of Software Engineering for Business Information Systems (sebis) at TUM often entails dynamic and multi-faceted tasks. At sebis, we promote the responsible use of \textit{AI Assistants} in the effective and efficient completion of such work. However, in the spirit of ethical and transparent research, we require all student researchers working with sebis to disclose their usage of such assistants.

For examples of correct and incorrect AI Assistant usage, please refer to the original, unabridged version of this form, located at this \href{https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/file/11opikwrji2aw/Sebis-Public-Website/Student-Theses-Guided-Research/Guidelines-for-student-research-projects/240208%20sebis%20Responsible%20Research.pdf}{link}.

\section*{Use of \textit{AI Assistants} for Research Purposes}
\subsubsection*{I have used AI Assistant(s) for the purposes of my research as part of this thesis.}

\noindent \textbf{Explanation:}
I used generative AI, specifically Gemini 3 Pro, for the following purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Grammar and structured writing assistance
  \item Debugging and simple code generation
  \item Guided generation of code documentation (e.g. python docstrings, README files)
  \item Identifying literature for foundational concepts (e.g. ``Which book defines the Intersection over Union?'')
\end{enumerate}

At no point did I use any code or text excerpts generated by AI for the purposes of my thesis without rigorously determining their correctness. Any sources cited in this paper were extensively reviewed manually by me before including them in my research.

I confirm in signing below, that I have reported all usage of AI Assistants for my research, and that the report is truthful and complete.
