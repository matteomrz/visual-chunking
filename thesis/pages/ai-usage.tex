\chapter*{AI Assistant Usage Disclosure}

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Performing work or conducting research at the Chair of Software Engineering for Business Information Systems (sebis) at TUM often entails dynamic and multi-faceted tasks. At sebis, we promote the responsible use of \textit{AI Assistants} in the effective and efficient completion of such work. However, in the spirit of ethical and transparent research, we require all student researchers working with sebis to disclose their usage of such assistants.

For examples of correct and incorrect AI Assistant usage, please refer to the original, unabridged version of this form, located at this \href{https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/file/11opikwrji2aw/Sebis-Public-Website/Student-Theses-Guided-Research/Guidelines-for-student-research-projects/240208%20sebis%20Responsible%20Research.pdf}{link}.
